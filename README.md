# Moonshot-project

This project has for objective to create a tool that will go through a project's source code, and isolate the different elements of the project by their type(functions, contants, variables). After isolating them the program would return them in different files according to their type(i.e. one file for the functions, on for the variables etc).

This tool is designed to run on C projects; the resulting folder of files has no guarenty to compile/run, the resulting folder is intended to be used as a catalog of the projects elements, intended to be used when working on large/complex projects.
