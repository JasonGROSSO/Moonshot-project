Animated Wallpaper Generator (AWG) is a tool that allows you to create animated wallpaper with a simple prompt.

The AWG uses AI in order to generate the images for the wallpaper.

The user enters a prompt in the tool, and is returned a first image, that he will be able to modify to his hearts content.
Once done the tool will generate the rest of the images and ask for validation, rinse and repeat.

At the end the user will be returned a file that he will be able to use as a wallpaper.
