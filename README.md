# Moonshot Project

## Definition

It is the showcase of your know-how, which allows students to validate, at the end of the course, that all the skills targeted by the training have been mastered. Three productions are expected: all the source codes of the project, a written report in English, and an oral presentation in English in front of a jury of professionals.

## Overview

This project's aim is to create a Visual Studio Code extension that will allow it's users to get informations about the code they are working on.
The extension will be able to track data changes, the execution path as well as get the location of each instance of each component of the code.
