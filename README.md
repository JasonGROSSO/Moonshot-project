Animated Wallpaper Generator (AWG) is a tool that allows its users to create animated wallpaper via a prompt.

The AWG uses AI in order to generate the images for the wallpaper. 
The product will be a loop of generated images assembled together to form an animated wallpaper.

The user enters a prompt and the tool will return to the user the first image of the loop, the user will the be able to modify the image via the prompt.
Once the first image is validated the tool will generate the rest of the loop, diplay it to the user, ask for confirmation, and save the loop plus the prompt.

At the end the user will be returned a file that he will be able to use as an animated wallpaper.
