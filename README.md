# Moonshot-project

A tool that will go through a project's source code, and isolate the differents componants of the project by type(functions, contants, variables). After isolating them the program would return them in different files according to their type(i.e. one file for the functions, on for the variables etc).

The group of files then created has no guarentee to either compile or run. This tool is only used for sorting a projects componants.
