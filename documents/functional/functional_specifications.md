# Functional Specifications

## Overview

This document describes the functional specifications of the Moonshot project. The aim of this project is to create a Visual Studio Code extension that will allow its users to get information about the code they are working on. The extension will be able to track data changes, the execution path, as well as get the location of each instance of each component of the code.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux, and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring. It is highly customizable, allowing users to install extensions that add new features or extend existing ones.

### Visual Studio Code Extensions

---

A Visual Studio Code extension is a set of components that can be added to the editor to add new features or extend existing ones. Extensions can be written in either JavaScript or TypeScript and can use the full range of functionality available in Visual Studio Code.
