## Context

As a developer, I often encounter projects where it is really hard to know what is happening, from where the informations are coming from and where they are going to, and what happens is usually that I end up picking a file at random to see if it contains the next step of the program. Which can take a long time if there is a huge number of files or if the files are particuraly long.
So I wanted to create a tool that would help developers to limit time spent on understanding the projects they are working on.
